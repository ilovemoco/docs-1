# What is TokenUp?

TokenUp is a solution for transitioning from Web2 to Web3, where users no longer need to worry about what a wallet is or concern themselves with the underlying blockchain.

## Features

1. `Security`. TokenUp leverages operating system-level security Passkeys. This allows users to enjoy convenience while doubling down on security for their assets.
2. `Convenient on mobile`. Web3 application interaction on mobile is very difficult, with deep linking being incomplete and opening Dapps within wallets being unacceptable to most users. TokenUp provides its own solution, perfectly addressing this point.
3. `Web2 Friendly`. Dapps require wallet support since wallets provide features like signing and on-chain transactions. However, downloading and using a wallet is the biggest barrier preventing Web2 users from adopting Web3. TokenUp perfectly solves this issue.
4. `Easy Access`. TokenUp Use `@tokenup/web3kit` package to interact with multiple chains and reduce development costs.
5. `Start-up Co. Support`. TokenUp has its own Dapp platform. After accessing TokenUp, you can apply for access and will receive traffic support.
