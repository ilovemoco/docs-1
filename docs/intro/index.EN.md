Wallet, by default, refers to a decentralized Web3 wallet, which is a wallet in which the user has full control over private keys and assets, without relying on third-party institutions (such as banks or exchanges). A Web3 wallet is a digital wallet used to store, send and receive cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), etc. Wallets are key tools for accessing and interacting with the Web3 world (including blockchains, decentralized applications (DApps) and other crypto assets).

    Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)

    A non-fungible token is a unit of data stored on a blockchain (digital ledger) that can represent unique digital assets such as artworks. It is a cryptographic token, but unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, it is not interchangeable. A non-fungible token is created by uploading a file, such as a work of art, to the non-fungible token auction market, which creates a copy of the file recorded on the digital ledger as a non-fungible token that can be purchased and resold with cryptocurrency.

# TokenUp Wallet

It is the world's leading multi-chain self-hosted wallet, supporting EthereumEVM-compatible networks and Ethereum Layer2, as well as non-EVM-compatible networks such as Bitcoin, TRON, and Solana. The private keys and mnemonics of TokenUp users are only stored in the user's own device, and the user's assets are completely controlled by the user.

The TokenUp product series includes mobile wallets and web wallets, building a comprehensive wallet product service for users. With the TokenUp wallet, you can easily connect to multiple mainstream networks, thousands of DApp applications, and the entire Web3 ecosystem project! In addition, users can also enjoy the one-stop decentralized trading and market services provided by TokenUp.

## Advantages of TokenUp

* "Security". TokenUp uses operating system-level security keys, allowing users to enjoy convenience while doubly protecting asset security.

* "Mobile convenience". Web3 applications are very difficult to interact with on mobile devices, deep linking functions are imperfect, and opening DApps in wallets is difficult for most users to accept. TokenUp provides its own solution, which perfectly solves this problem.

* "Web2 friendly". DApps need wallet support because wallets provide features such as signatures and on-chain transactions. However, downloading and using wallets is the biggest barrier preventing Web2 users from adopting Web3. TokenUp solves this problem perfectly.
* "Easy access". TokenUp uses the `@tokenup/web3kit` package to interact with multiple chains, reducing development costs.
* "Startup support". TokenUp has its own DApp platform. After connecting to TokenUp, you can apply for access and get traffic support.
