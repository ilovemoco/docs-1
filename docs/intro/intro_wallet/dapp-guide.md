# **DApp Guide**

# What is a DApp?

DApps (Decentralized Applications) are websites powered by smart contracts that run on blockchains rather than centralized servers. 

# What are the precautions for using DApps?

1. Using a DApp, check whether the project has an audit report from a legitimate security company. lf the code has not been audited, it can contain malicious functions which may misappropriate user assets.

2. When a DApp asks for approval from you, please check and ensure you are clear about the approved content. Never approve anything that you do not understand.

3. In order to avoid repeated approval by users, DApp developers usually set the maximum number of tokens authorized to smart contracts by default. Therefore, when performing authorization, an appropriate limit for the authorized amount of tokens should be set to avoid all of the tokens being stolen from malicious approvals.

# What are Phishing scams

Phishing scams usually use email or instant messaging, leading users to a fake website that looks almost identical to the official website, defrauding users of mnemonic phrases or private keys, or inducing users to approve their fraudulent smart contracts to steal user assets.

# How to prevent phishing scams?

1. Don't easily trust the links sent to you by others; don't open any websites sent to you by strangers.

2. Double check whether a link is official before opening it. For example: 'opensea.io' is the official website; 'opensea-official.io' is a phishing website.

3. Do not enter mnemonic phrases and private keys on any website.


# Disclaimer for using Dapps

Before using third-party DApps, please be sure to understand the following disclaimer:

1. Third-party DApps do not belong to TokenUp, and the DApps are completely controlled by the project parties! Please be sure to understand the security of the DApps before using them.

2. You understand that any loss caused by your use of a certain DApp will be borne by you personally and has nothing to do with TokenUp.

3. lf you encounter any problems in the process of using the DApp, you need to contact the third-party project team to solve it yourself.
